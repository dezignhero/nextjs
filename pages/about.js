              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                The student loan debt crisis is postponing the American Dream
                for 46 million borrowers-- and the rules to reduce payments and
                forgive debt are so confusing that public officials say the
                system is broken. Founded in 2017 by long-time student loan
                experts and advocates, Aaron Smith and Tobin Van-Ostern, Savi is
                a social impact technology startup in Washington, D.C. working
                to solve the student debt crisis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Savi was founded on the principle that America's loan borrowers,
                who hold $1.7 trillion of debt, deserve help navigating the
                complex student loan system. Using innovative technology and a
                team of thoughtful industry leaders, we help loan borrowers
                discover new repayment and loan forgiveness options. So far,
                we've identified $200+ million in projected forgiveness for
                student loan borrowers who have signed up with Savi as a unique
                student loan benefit provided by their employer, membership
                organization, or financial institution.
